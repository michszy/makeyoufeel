# makeyoufeel
Just before joining the data / AI Microsoft school, I was working on this application for Android smartphone app ...

It is unfinishied because since I join the Microsoft school I am 100% turn toward the AI and next time I'll work on it, it will be to become a chatbot.

So the main usage of the app was for the user to put the mood in which he is right now (sad, lonely, heartbroken, bored, ...), then to select the mood in which we would like to be (happy, inspired, hopefull, amused, ... ) and a selection of quotes, meme, articles, publication and vids will be proposed to him or her to make him feel the way he desired.
